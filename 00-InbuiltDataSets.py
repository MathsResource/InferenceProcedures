## Downloading Sample Data

# - Some of the Bokeh examples rely on sample data that is not included 
# - in the Bokeh GitHub repository or released packages, due to their size. 
# - Once Bokeh is installed, the sample data can be obtained by executing 
# - the following command at a Bash or Windows prompt:

# bokeh sampledata

\subsection{Independent one-sample $t$-test}
In testing the null hypothesis that the population mean is equal to a specified value $\mu_{0}$, one uses the statistic

\begin{equation}t = \frac{\overline{x} - \mu_0}{s / \sqrt{n}}\end{equation}

where $s$ is the sample standard deviation and $n$ is the sample size. The degrees of freedom used in this test is $n - 1$.





later, remember that a confidence interval is a \textbf{two-tailed} procedure, i.e. $k=2$.

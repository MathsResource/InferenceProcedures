Interpreting p-values

The p-value is the probability of having observed our data (or more extreme data) when the null hypothesis is true 

The smaller the p-value, the less likely it is that the sample results come from a situation where the null hypothesis H0 is true. If the p-value is sufficiently small, we reject the null hypothesis, and support the alternative hypothesis Ha.


One Sided Tests

p-value  >  0.05   :   no evidence against H0 in favour of Ha

p-value    <  0.05   :   evidence against H0 in favour of Ha

Two Sided Tests

p-value    >  0.025   :   no evidence against H0 in favour of Ha

p-value    <  0.025   :   evidence against H0 in favour of Ha

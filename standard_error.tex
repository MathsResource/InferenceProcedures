\textbf{Standard Error}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The standard error measures the dispersion of the sampling distribution.
	\item For each type of point estimate, there is a corresponding standard error.
	\item A full list of standard error formulae will be attached in your examination paper.
	\item The standard error for a  mean is
	\[ S.E( \bar{x} )  = {\sigma \over \sqrt{n}} \]
	However, we often do not know the value for $\sigma$. For practical purposes, we use the sample standard deviation $s$ as an estimate for $\sigma$ instead.
	\[ S.E( \bar{x} )  = {s \over \sqrt{n}} \]
\end{itemize}

\section*{Confidence Intervals for Proportions}
Of a sample of 160 computer programmers, 56 reported than Python was their primary programming language.
\begin{enumerate}[(a)]
	\item Let $\pi$ be the proportion of all programmers who regard Python as their programming language. What is the point estimate for $\pi$ (expressed as a percentage)?
	\item Compute a $95\%$ confidence interval for $\pi$.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{framed}
	\textbf{Confidence Intervals for Sample Proportion}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The structure of a confidence interval for sample proportion is 
		\[ \hat{p} \pm z_{(\alpha/2)} \times \mbox{S.E.}(\hat{p})\]
		
		\item The standard error, in the case of sample proportions, is
		\[ \mbox{S.E.}(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}\times (1-\hat{p})}{n}}\]
		
	\end{itemize}
\end{framed}

\begin{description}
	\item[Point Estimate] The sample proportion is computed as follows
	\[ \hat{p} = \frac{x}{n} = \frac{56}{160} = 0.35 \;\; \mbox{ i.e. }35\%\]
	\item[Quantile] We are asked for a 95\% confidence interval.The sample size is greater than 30. The quantile is therefore
	\[ Z_{\alpha/2} =1.96\]
	\item[Standard Error] The standard error, with sample size n=120 is computed as follows
	\[ \mbox{S.E.}(\hat{p}) = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \times (1-\hat{p})}{n}} =  \sqrt{\frac{0.35 \times 0.65}{160}}\]
\noindent In terms of percentages:
\[
S.E. (\hat{p}) \;=\; \sqrt{\frac{\hat{p} \times (100-\hat{p})}{n}} \;=\; \sqrt{ {35 \times 65 \over 160 }} =  3.77\%
\] 
\end{description}

\noindent Piecing it together.

\[
35\% \pm (1.96 \times 3.77) \%  = (35 \pm7.4) \% = (27.6\%,42.4\%)
\]
\smallskip
\noindent The 95\% confidence interval for the true proportion is (27.6\%,42.4\%).

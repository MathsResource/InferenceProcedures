\frametitle{The Paired t-test}
A paired t-test is used to compare two population means where you have two samples in
which observations in one sample can be \textbf{\emph{paired}} with observations in the other sample.\\
\bigskip
Examples of where this might occur are:
\begin{itemize}
\item Before-and-after observations on the same subjects (e.g. students’ diagnostic test
results before and after a particular module or course).
\item A comparison of two different methods of measurement or two different treatments
where the measurements/treatments are applied to the \textbf{\emph{same}} subjects.
\end{itemize}
The difference between two paired measurements is known as a \textbf{\emph{case-wise}} difference.

\begin{itemize}
\item We will often be required to compute the case-wise differences, the average of those differences and the standard deviation of those difference.

\item The mean difference for a set of differences between paired observations is
\[ \bar{d} = {\sum d_i \over n }\]

\item The computational formula for the standard deviation of the differences
between paired observations is
\[s_d = \sqrt{ {\sum d_i^2 - n\bar{d}^2 \over n-1}}\]
\item It is nearly always a small sample test.
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
\item $\mu_d$ mean value for the population of case-wise differences.
\item The null hypothesis is that that $\mu_d = 0$
\item Given $\bar{d}$ mean value for the sample of differences, and $s_d$ standard deviation of the differences for the paired sample data, we can compute this test in the same manner as a one-sample test for the mean
\end{itemize}

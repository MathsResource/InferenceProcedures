To test the null hypothesis that the true mean difference is zero, the procedure is as
follows:
1. Calculate the difference $(di = y_i − x_i)$ between the two observations on each pair,
making sure you distinguish between positive and negative differences.
2. Calculate the mean difference, $\bar{d}$.


3. Calculate the standard deviation of the differences, $s_d$, and use this to calculate the
standard error of the mean difference, $SE(\bar{d}) = {s_d \over \sqrt{n}}$

4. Calculate the t-statistic, which is given by $ T ={ \bar{d} \over SE(\bar{d})}$.

Under the null hypothesis, this statistic follows a t-distribution with $n − 1$ degrees of freedom.
